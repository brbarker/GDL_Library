# GDL_Library
This is a collection of the .pro files I've written while creating a library of code for Astrophysics use at Ursinus College.

The "Master.pro" file is the most recent final product and contains all of the other .pro file content within it. It is intended as a standalone product while each of the other .pro files can be used as faster, more direct routes if the user knows which specific procedure they want to use.
